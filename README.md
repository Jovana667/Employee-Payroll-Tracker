# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

## Description
In this take I was challenged to enhances a starter code for a payroll management system, adding functionality to track employee data and assist with company budgeting.

## Features
- Users can input employee information (first name, last name, and salary) via a prompt triggered when the 'Add Employee' button has been clicked.
- The Employee data will be displayed on the webpage and sorted alphabetically by last name.
- The console will display computed and aggregated data, including:
  - Employee data and array numbers displayed in a HTML table
  - Average employee salary
  - A randomly selected employee as the "drawing winner"

## How to Use
1. Click the 'Add Employee' button to enter details (first name, last name and salary).
3. When all details have been added click 'Cancel' in the prompt to finish.
4. The provided employee data will be listed alphabetically by last name on the webpage.
5. Open the browser console to see additional computed data.
